## Existing Architecture Guidelines

### Database Design
- Use SQLite migrations in `src/database/migrations/`
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Include proper indexing for performance
- Add soft delete columns where appropriate

### API Design
- RESTful endpoints in `src/api/` directory
- Use existing authentication middleware
- Include proper error handling and logging
- Follow rate limiting patterns

### Dashboard Integration
- Components in `client/src/components/`
- Use existing styling system (Tailwind + Material-UI)
- Implement real-time updates via Socket.io
- Follow permission guard patterns

### Bot Integration
- Commands in `src/commands/` with proper categorization
- Use existing embed and interaction utilities
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow command localization patterns

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ESLint and Prettier formatting
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging for debugging and analytics

### Security Requirements
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper permission checks
- Rate limiting implementation
- Secure data handling

### Performance Standards
- Database query optimization
- Efficient memory usage
- Proper caching strategies
- Scalable architecture patterns

## Review Process

1. **Specification Review**: Ensure alignment with business goals
2. **Technical Review**: Validate architecture integration
3. **Security Review**: Confirm security best practices
4. **UX Review**: Validate user experience consistency
5. **Performance Review**: Assess scaling implications
